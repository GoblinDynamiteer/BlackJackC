#BLACKJACK C

---

*Blackjack game in C.* 

Project for practice in C programming, and english.
At the moment only the basic blackjack rules work, bet/hit/stay.
The plan is to make it as similar to swedish pub/club play as possible.

Opposite to my prior larger C projects, this code has commenting in english.

Future version might have a simple GUI made with curses lib, if I can pull that off.
