TODO:
Raise Double:
	on 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 on first deal - ACE counts as 1

Insurance:
	First dealer card is ACE, player adds 0.5x to bet.
	If dealer gets natural, player gets 2x insurance, but loses original bet.
	ex: bet 30 -> insurance 15 -> dealer gets natural -> bet = -30 + 15x2 = 0

	If dealer does not get natural, the insurance is lost, but original
	bet is kept.

Split 2 ACEs:
	Only +1 card per ACE, unless ACE -> can split agian.
	10+ACE counts as 21 and not natural blackjack
